          ClusterBpfApplication is the schema for the cluster scoped BPF Applications
          API. This API allows applications to use bpfman to load and attach one or
          more eBPF programs on a Kubernetes cluster.


          The clusterBpfApplication.status field reports the overall status of the
          ClusterBpfApplication CRD. A given ClusterBpfApplication CRD can result in
          loading and attaching multiple eBPF programs on multiple nodes, so this
          status is just a summary. More granular per-node status details can be
          found in the corresponding ClusterBpfApplicationState CRD that bpfman
          creates for each node.

              spec defines the desired state of the ClusterBpfApplication. The
              ClusterBpfApplication describes the set of one or more cluster scoped eBPF
              programs that should be loaded for a given application and attributes for
              how they should be loaded. eBPF programs that are grouped together under the

                                      fields under interfacesDiscoveryConfig to control what is allow and excluded

                        programs are attached to network devices (interfaces). The program can be
                        attached on either packet ingress or egress, so the program will be called
                        on every incoming or outgoing packet seen by the network device. The TCX

                        after the Linux kernel has allocated an sk_buff. This makes TCX useful for
                        packet classification actions. TCX is a newer implementation of TC with
                        enhanced performance and better support for running multiple programs on a
                        given network device.

                            TCX program should be attached. The TCX program is loaded in kernel memory
                            when the BPF Application CRD is created and the selected Kubernetes nodes
                            are active. The TCX program will not be triggered until the program has also
                            been attached to an attachment point described in this list. Items may be
                            added or removed from the list at any point, causing the TCX program to be
                            attached or detached.


                            The attachment point for a TCX program is a network interface (or device).
                            The interface can be specified by name, by allowing bpfman to discover each
                            interface, or by setting the primaryNodeInterface flag, which instructs
                            bpfman to use the primary interface of a Kubernetes node. Optionally, the
                            TCX program can also be installed into a set of network namespaces.

                        Tracepoint programs. Whereas KProbes attach to dynamically to any Linux
                        kernel function, Tracepoint programs are programs that can only be attached
                        at predefined locations in the Linux kernel. Use the following command to
                        see the available attachment points:
                         `sudo find /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events -type d`
                        While KProbes are more flexible in where in the kernel the probe can be
                        attached, the functions and data structure rely on the kernel your system is
                        running. Tracepoints tend to be more stable across kernel versions and are
                        better for portability.

                        type is a required field used to specify the type of the eBPF program.

                          FEntry, FExit, KProbe, KRetProbe, TC, TCX, TracePoint, UProbe, URetProbe,
                          XDP


                        When set to FEntry, the program is attached to the entry of a Linux kernel
                        function or to another eBPF program function. When using the FEntry program
                        type, the fentry field is required. See fentry for more details on FEntry
                        programs.


                        When set to FExit, the program is attached to the exit of a Linux kernel
                        function or to another eBPF program function. When using the FExit program
                        type, the fexit field is required. See fexit for more details on FExit
                        programs.


                        When set to KProbe, the program is attached to entry of a Linux kernel
                        function. When using the KProbe program type, the kprobe field is required.
                        See kprobe for more details on KProbe programs.


                        When set to KRetProbe, the program is attached to exit of a Linux kernel
                        function. When using the KRetProbe program type, the kretprobe field is
                        required. See kretprobe for more details on KRetProbe programs.


                        When set to TC, the eBPF program can attach to network devices (interfaces).
                        The program can be attached on either packet ingress or egress, so the
                        program will be called on every incoming or outgoing packet seen by the
                        network device. When using the TC program type, the tc field is required.
                        See tc for more details on TC programs.


                        When set to TCX, the eBPF program can attach to network devices
                        (interfaces). The program can be attached on either packet ingress or
                        egress, so the program will be called on every incoming or outgoing packet
                        seen by the network device. When using the TCX program type, the tcx field
                        is required. See tcx for more details on TCX programs.


                        When set to Tracepoint, the program can attach to one of the predefined set
                        of Linux kernel functions. When using the Tracepoint program type, the
                        tracepoint field is required. See tracepoint for more details on Tracepoint
                        programs.


                        When set to UProbe, the program can attach in user-space. The UProbe is
                        attached to a binary, library or function name, and optionally an offset in
                        the code. When using the UProbe program type, the uprobe field is required.
                        See uprobe for more details on UProbe programs.


                        When set to URetProbe, the program can attach in user-space.
                        The URetProbe is attached to the return of a binary, library or function
                        name, and optionally an offset in the code.  When using the URetProbe
                        program type, the uretprobe field is required. See uretprobe for more
                        details on URetProbe programs.


                        When set to XDP, the eBPF program can attach to network devices (interfaces)
                        and will be called on every incoming packet received by the network device.
                        When using the XDP program type, the xdp field is required. See xdp for more
                        details on XDP programs.

                            The attachment point for a UProbe and URetProbe program is a user-space

                            of the attachment point, but the attachment point can be adjusted using an
                            optional function name and/or offset. Optionally, the eBPF program can be
                            installed in a set of containers or limited to a specified PID.

                            optional function name and/or offset. Optionally, the eBPF program can be
                            installed in a set of containers or limited to a specified PID.
