          BpfApplication is the schema for the namespace scoped BPF Applications API.
          This API allows applications to use bpfman to load and attach one or more
          eBPF programs on a Kubernetes cluster.


          The bpfApplication.status field reports the overall status of the
          BpfApplication CRD. A given BpfApplication CRD can result in loading and
          attaching multiple eBPF programs on multiple nodes, so this status is just a
          summary. More granular per-node status details can be found in the
          corresponding BpfApplicationState CRD that bpfman creates for each node.

                            The attachment point for a TC program is a network interface (or device).
                            The interface can be specified by name, by allowing bpfman to discover each
                            interface, or by setting the primaryNodeInterface flag, which instructs
                            bpfman to use the primary interface of a Kubernetes node. Optionally, the
                            TC program can also be installed into a set of network namespaces.

                        tcx is an optional field, but required when the type field is set to TCX.
                        tcx defines the desired state of the application's TCX programs. TCX
                        programs are attached to network devices (interfaces). The program can be
                        attached on either packet ingress or egress, so the program will be called
                        on every incoming or outgoing packet seen by the network device. The TCX
                        attachment point is in Linux's Traffic Control (tc) subsystem, which is
                        after the Linux kernel has allocated an sk_buff. This makes TCX useful for
                        packet classification actions. TCX is a newer implementation of TC with
                        enhanced performance and better support for running multiple programs on a
                        given network device.

                            when the BPF Application CRD is created and the selected Kubernetes nodes
                            are active. The TCX program will not be triggered until the program has also
                            been attached to an attachment point described in this list. Items may be
                            added or removed from the list at any point, causing the TCX program to be
                            attached or detached.


                            The attachment point for a TCX program is a network interface (or device).
                            The interface can be specified by name, by allowing bpfman to discover each
                            interface, or by setting the primaryNodeInterface flag, which instructs
                            bpfman to use the primary interface of a Kubernetes node. Optionally, the
                            TCX program can also be installed into a set of network namespaces.

                        type is a required field used to specify the type of the eBPF program.


                        Allowed values are:
                          TC, TCX, UProbe, URetProbe, XDP


                        When set to TC, the eBPF program can attach to network devices (interfaces).
                        The program can be attached on either packet ingress or egress, so the
                        program will be called on every incoming or outgoing packet seen by the
                        network device. When using the TC program type, the tc field is required.
                        See tc for more details on TC programs.


                        When set to TCX, the eBPF program can attach to network devices
                        (interfaces). The program can be attached on either packet ingress or
                        egress, so the program will be called on every incoming or outgoing packet
                        seen by the network device. When using the TCX program type, the tcx field
                        is required. See tcx for more details on TCX programs.


                        When set to UProbe, the program can attach in user-space. The UProbe is
                        attached to a binary, library or function name, and optionally an offset in
                        the code. When using the UProbe program type, the uprobe field is required.
                        See uprobe for more details on UProbe programs.


                        When set to URetProbe, the program can attach in user-space.
                        The URetProbe is attached to the return of a binary, library or function
                        name, and optionally an offset in the code.  When using the URetProbe
                        program type, the uretprobe field is required. See uretprobe for more
                        details on URetProbe programs.


                        When set to XDP, the eBPF program can attach to network devices (interfaces)
                        and will be called on every incoming packet received by the network device.
                        When using the XDP program type, the xdp field is required. See xdp for more
                        details on XDP programs.

                        programs. UProbe programs are user-space probes. A target must be provided,

                        probe is attached. Optionally, a function name can also be provided to
                        provide finer granularity on where the probe is attached. They can be
                        attached at any point in the binary, library or function using the optional
                        offset field. However, caution must be taken when using the offset, ensuring
                        the offset is still in the desired bytecode.

                            in kernel memory when the BPF Application CRD is created and the selected
                            Kubernetes nodes are active. The eBPF program will not be triggered until
                            the program has also been attached to an attachment point described in this
                            list. Items may be added or removed from the list at any point, causing the
                            eBPF program to be attached or detached.


                            The attachment point for a UProbe and URetProbe program is a user-space
                            binary or function. By default, the eBPF program is triggered at the entry
                            of the attachment point, but the attachment point can be adjusted using an
                            optional function name and/or offset. Optionally, the eBPF program can be
                            installed in a set of containers or limited to a specified PID.

                            optional function name and/or offset. Optionally, the eBPF program can be
                            installed in a set of containers or limited to a specified PID.

                            XDP program should be attached. The XDP program is loaded in kernel memory
                            when the BPF Application CRD is created and the selected Kubernetes nodes
                            are active. The XDP program will not be triggered until the program has also
                            been attached to an attachment point described in this list. Items may be
                            added or removed from the list at any point, causing the XDP program to be
                            attached or detached.


                            The attachment point for a XDP program is a network interface (or device).
                            The interface can be specified by name, by allowing bpfman to discover each
                            interface, or by setting the primaryNodeInterface flag, which instructs
                            bpfman to use the primary interface of a Kubernetes node.

                                  codes from an XDP eBPF program, are:
                                    Aborted, Drop, Pass, TX, ReDirect,DispatcherReturn


                                  Multiple values are supported. Default is Pass and DispatcherReturn. So
                                  using the default values, if an XDP program returns Pass, the next XDP
                                  program in the chain will be called. If an XDP program returns Drop, the
                                  next XDP program in the chain will NOT be called.
