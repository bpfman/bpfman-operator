VERSION:    v1alpha1

DESCRIPTION:
    BpfApplication is the schema for the namespace scoped BPF Applications API.
    This API allows applications to use bpfman to load and attach one or more
    eBPF programs on a Kubernetes cluster.
    
    
    The bpfApplication.status field reports the overall status of the
    BpfApplication CRD. A given BpfApplication CRD can result in loading and
    attaching multiple eBPF programs on multiple nodes, so this status is just a
    summary. More granular per-node status details can be found in the
    corresponding BpfApplicationState CRD that bpfman creates for each node.
    
FIELDS:
  apiVersion	<string>
    APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
    Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
    may reject unrecognized values. More info:
    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

  kind	<string>
    Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
    represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
    requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

  metadata	<ObjectMeta>
    Standard object's metadata. More info:
    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

  spec	<Object>
    spec defines the desired state of the BpfApplication. The BpfApplication
    describes the set of one or more namespace scoped eBPF programs that should
    be loaded for a given application and attributes for how they should be
    loaded. eBPF programs that are grouped together under the same
    BpfApplication instance can share maps and global data between the eBPF
    programs loaded on the same Kubernetes Node.

  status	<Object>
    status reflects the status of a BPF Application and indicates if all the
    eBPF programs for a given instance loaded successfully or not.

FIELDS:
  byteCode	<Object> -required-
    bytecode is a required field and configures where the eBPF program's
    bytecode should be loaded from. The image must contain one or more
    eBPF programs.

  globalData	<map[string]string>
    globalData is an optional field that allows the user to set global variables
    when the program is loaded. This allows the same compiled bytecode to be
    deployed by different BPF Applications to behave differently based on
    globalData configuration values.  It uses an array of raw bytes. This is a
    very low level primitive. The caller is responsible for formatting the byte
    string appropriately considering such things as size, endianness, alignment
    and packing of data structures.

  mapOwnerSelector	<Object>
    mapOwnerSelector is an optional field used to share maps across
    applications. eBPF programs loaded with the same ClusterBpfApplication or
    BpfApplication instance do not need to use this field. This label selector
    allows maps from a different ClusterBpfApplication or BpfApplication
    instance to be used by this instance.
    TODO: mapOwnerSelector is currently not supported due to recent code rework.

  nodeSelector	<Object> -required-
    nodeSelector is a required field and allows the user to specify which
    Kubernetes nodes to deploy the eBPF programs. To select all nodes use
    standard metav1.LabelSelector semantics and make it empty.

  programs	<[]Object>
    programs is a required field and is the list of eBPF programs in a BPF
    Application CRD that should be loaded in kernel memory. At least one entry
    is required. eBPF programs in this list will be loaded on the system based
    the nodeSelector. Even if an eBPF program is loaded in kernel memory, it
    cannot be triggered until an attachment point is provided. The different
    program types have different ways of attaching. The attachment points can be
    added at creation time or modified (added or removed) at a later time to
    activate or deactivate the eBPF program as desired.
    CAUTION: When programs are added or removed from the list, that requires all
    programs in the list to be reloaded, which could be temporarily service
    effecting. For this reason, modifying the list is currently not allowed.

  tc	<Object>
    tc is an optional field, but required when the type field is set to TC. tc
    defines the desired state of the application's TC programs. TC programs are
    attached to network devices (interfaces). The program can be attached on
    either packet ingress or egress, so the program will be called on every
    incoming or outgoing packet seen by the network device. The TC attachment
    point is in Linux's Traffic Control (tc) subsystem, which is after the
    Linux kernel has allocated an sk_buff. TCX is newer implementation of TC
    with enhanced performance and better support for running multiple programs
    on a given network device. This makes TC useful for packet classification
    actions.

  tcx	<Object>
    tcx is an optional field, but required when the type field is set to TCX.
    tcx defines the desired state of the application's TCX programs. TCX
    programs are attached to network devices (interfaces). The program can be
    attached on either packet ingress or egress, so the program will be called
    on every incoming or outgoing packet seen by the network device. The TCX
    attachment point is in Linux's Traffic Control (tc) subsystem, which is

    When set to TC, the eBPF program can attach to network devices (interfaces).
    The program can be attached on either packet ingress or egress, so the
    program will be called on every incoming or outgoing packet seen by the
    network device. When using the TC program type, the tc field is required.
    See tc for more details on TC programs.
    
    
    When set to TCX, the eBPF program can attach to network devices
    (interfaces). The program can be attached on either packet ingress or
    egress, so the program will be called on every incoming or outgoing packet
    seen by the network device. When using the TCX program type, the tcx field
    is required. See tcx for more details on TCX programs.
    
    
    When set to UProbe, the program can attach in user-space. The UProbe is
    attached to a binary, library or function name, and optionally an offset in
    the code. When using the UProbe program type, the uprobe field is required.
    See uprobe for more details on UProbe programs.
    
    
    When set to URetProbe, the program can attach in user-space.
    The URetProbe is attached to the return of a binary, library or function
    name, and optionally an offset in the code.  When using the URetProbe
    program type, the uretprobe field is required. See uretprobe for more
    details on URetProbe programs.

    details on XDP programs.

  uprobe	<Object>
    uprobe is an optional field, but required when the type field is set to
    UProbe. uprobe defines the desired state of the application's UProbe
    programs. UProbe programs are user-space probes. A target must be provided,
    which is the library name or absolute path to a binary or library where the
    probe is attached. Optionally, a function name can also be provided to
    provide finer granularity on where the probe is attached. They can be
    attached at any point in the binary, library or function using the optional
    offset field. However, caution must be taken when using the offset, ensuring
    the offset is still in the desired bytecode.

  uretprobe	<Object>
    uretprobe is an optional field, but required when the type field is set to
    URetProbe. uretprobe defines the desired state of the application's
    URetProbe programs. URetProbe programs are user-space probes. A target must
    be provided, which is the library name or absolute path to a binary or
    library where the probe is attached. Optionally, a function name can also be
    provided to provide finer granularity on where the probe is attached. They
    are attached to the return point of the binary, library or function, but can
    be set anywhere using the optional offset field. However, caution must be
    taken when using the offset, ensuring the offset is still in the desired
    bytecode.

  xdp	<Object>
    xdp is an optional field, but required when the type field is set to XDP.
    xdp defines the desired state of the application's XDP programs. XDP program
    can be attached to network devices (interfaces) and will be called on every
    incoming packet received by the network device. The XDP attachment point is
    just after the packet has been received off the wire, but before the Linux
    kernel has allocated an sk_buff, which is used to pass the packet through
    the kernel networking stack.

FIELDS:
  links	<[]Object>
    links is an optional field and is the list of attachment points to which the
    TC program should be attached. The TC program is loaded in kernel memory
    when the BPF Application CRD is created and the selected Kubernetes nodes
    are active. The TC program will not be triggered until the program has also
    been attached to an attachment point described in this list. Items may be
    added or removed from the list at any point, causing the TC program to be
    attached or detached.
    
    
    The attachment point for a TC program is a network interface (or device).
    The interface can be specified by name, by allowing bpfman to discover each
    interface, or by setting the primaryNodeInterface flag, which instructs
    bpfman to use the primary interface of a Kubernetes node. Optionally, the
    TC program can also be installed into a set of network namespaces.

  networkNamespaces	<Object> -required-
    networkNamespaces is a required field that identifies the set of network
    namespaces in which to attach the eBPF program.

  priority	<integer>
    priority is an optional field and determines the execution order of the TC
    program relative to other TC programs attached to the same attachment point.
    It must be a value between 0 and 1000, where lower values indicate higher
    precedence. For TC programs on the same attachment point with the same
    direction and priority, the most recently attached program has a lower
    precedence. If not provided, priority will default to 1000.

  proceedOn	<[]string>
    proceedOn is an optional field and allows the user to call other TC programs
    in a chain, or not call the next program in a chain based on the exit code
    of a TC program. Allowed values, which are the possible exit codes from a TC
    eBPF program, are:
      UnSpec, OK, ReClassify, Shot, Pipe, Stolen, Queued, Repeat, ReDirect,
      Trap, DispatcherReturn
    
    
    Multiple values are supported. Default is OK, Pipe and DispatcherReturn. So
    using the default values, if a TC program returns Pipe, the next TC
    program in the chain will be called. If a TC program returns Stolen, the
    next TC program in the chain will NOT be called.

FIELD: tcx <Object>


DESCRIPTION:
    tcx is an optional field, but required when the type field is set to TCX.
    tcx defines the desired state of the application's TCX programs. TCX
    programs are attached to network devices (interfaces). The program can be
    attached on either packet ingress or egress, so the program will be called
    on every incoming or outgoing packet seen by the network device. The TCX
    attachment point is in Linux's Traffic Control (tc) subsystem, which is
    after the Linux kernel has allocated an sk_buff. This makes TCX useful for
    packet classification actions. TCX is a newer implementation of TC with
    enhanced performance and better support for running multiple programs on a
    given network device.
    
FIELDS:
  links	<[]Object>
    links is an optional field and is the list of attachment points to which the
    TCX program should be attached. The TCX program is loaded in kernel memory
    when the BPF Application CRD is created and the selected Kubernetes nodes
    are active. The TCX program will not be triggered until the program has also
    been attached to an attachment point described in this list. Items may be
    added or removed from the list at any point, causing the TCX program to be
    attached or detached.
    
    
    The attachment point for a TCX program is a network interface (or device).
    The interface can be specified by name, by allowing bpfman to discover each
    interface, or by setting the primaryNodeInterface flag, which instructs
    bpfman to use the primary interface of a Kubernetes node. Optionally, the
    TCX program can also be installed into a set of network namespaces.

    When set to Egress, the TC program is triggered when packets are to be
    transmitted by the interface.

  interfaceSelector	<Object> -required-
    interfaceSelector is a required field and is used to determine the network
    interface (or interfaces) the TCX program is attached. Interface list is set

    the primaryNodeInterface flag, but only one option is allowed.

  networkNamespaces	<Object> -required-
    networkNamespaces is a required field that identifies the set of network
    namespaces in which to attach the eBPF program.

  priority	<integer>
    priority is an optional field and determines the execution order of the TCX
    program relative to other TCX programs attached to the same attachment
    point. It must be a value between 0 and 1000, where lower values indicate
    higher precedence. For TCX programs on the same attachment point with the
    same direction and priority, the most recently attached program has a lower
    precedence. If not provided, priority will default to 1000.

    for discovery. If an entry enclosed by slashes, such as `/br-/` or
    `/veth*/`, then the entry is considered as a regular expression for
    matching. Otherwise, the interface names in the list are case-sensitive.
    This field is only taken into consideration if interfaceAutoDiscovery is set
    to true.

  excludeInterfaces	<[]string>
    excludeInterfaces is an optional field that contains a list of interface
    names that are excluded from interface discovery. The interface names in

      Aborted, Drop, Pass, TX, ReDirect,DispatcherReturn
    
    
    Multiple values are supported. Default is Pass and DispatcherReturn. So
    using the default values, if an XDP program returns Pass, the next XDP
    program in the chain will be called. If an XDP program returns Drop, the
    next XDP program in the chain will NOT be called.

FIELD: interfaceSelector <Object>


DESCRIPTION:
    interfaceSelector is a required field and is used to determine the network
    interface (or interfaces) the XDP program is attached. Interface list is set
    by providing a list of interface names, enabling auto discovery, or setting
    the primaryNodeInterface flag, but only one option is allowed.
    
FIELDS:
  interfaces	<[]string>
    interfaces is an optional field and is a list of network interface names to
    attach the eBPF program. The interface names in the list are case-sensitive.

  interfacesDiscoveryConfig	<Object>
    interfacesDiscoveryConfig is an optional field that is used to control if
    and how to automatically discover interfaces. If the agent should
    automatically discover and attach eBPF programs to interfaces, use the
    fields under interfacesDiscoveryConfig to control what is allow and excluded
    from discovery.

  primaryNodeInterface	<boolean>
    primaryNodeInterface is and optional field and indicates to attach the eBPF
    program to the primary interface on the Kubernetes node. Only 'true' is
    accepted.

FIELD: interfacesDiscoveryConfig <Object>


DESCRIPTION:
    interfacesDiscoveryConfig is an optional field that is used to control if
    and how to automatically discover interfaces. If the agent should
    automatically discover and attach eBPF programs to interfaces, use the
    fields under interfacesDiscoveryConfig to control what is allow and excluded
    from discovery.
    
FIELDS:
  allowedInterfaces	<[]string>
    allowedInterfaces is an optional field that contains a list of interface
    names that are allowed to be discovered. If empty, the agent will fetch all
    the interfaces in the system, excepting the ones listed in
    excludeInterfaces. if non-empty, only entries in the list will be considered
    for discovery. If an entry enclosed by slashes, such as `/br-/` or
    `/veth*/`, then the entry is considered as a regular expression for
    matching. Otherwise, the interface names in the list are case-sensitive.
    This field is only taken into consideration if interfaceAutoDiscovery is set
    to true.

  excludeInterfaces	<[]string>
    excludeInterfaces is an optional field that contains a list of interface
    names that are excluded from interface discovery. The interface names in
    the list are case-sensitive. By default, the list contains the loopback
    interface, "lo". This field is only taken into consideration if
    interfaceAutoDiscovery is set to true.

  interfaceAutoDiscovery	<boolean>
    interfaceAutoDiscovery is an optional field. When enabled, the agent
    monitors the creation and deletion of interfaces and automatically
    attached eBPF programs to the newly discovered interfaces.
    CAUTION: This has the potential to attach a given eBPF program to a large
    number of interfaces. Use with caution.

FIELD: networkNamespaces <Object>


DESCRIPTION:
    networkNamespaces is a required field that identifies the set of network
    namespaces in which to attach the eBPF program.
    
FIELDS:
  pods	<Object> -required-
    pods is a required field and indicates the target pods. To select all pods
    use the standard metav1.LabelSelector semantics and make it empty.

FIELDS:
  matchExpressions	<[]Object>
    matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements
    are ANDed.

  matchLabels	<map[string]string>
    matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the
    matchLabels
    map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is
    "key", the
    operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The
    requirements are ANDed.

FIELD: matchExpressions <[]Object>


DESCRIPTION:
    matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements
    are ANDed.
    A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and
    an operator that
    relates the key and values.
    
FIELDS:
  key	<string> -required-
    key is the label key that the selector applies to.

  operator	<string> -required-
    operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.
    Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

  values	<[]string>
    values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,
    the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or
    DoesNotExist,
    the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
    merge patch.

FIELD: status <Object>


DESCRIPTION:
    status reflects the status of a BPF Application and indicates if all the
    eBPF programs for a given instance loaded successfully or not.
    
FIELDS:
  conditions	<[]Object>
    conditions contains the summary state for all eBPF programs defined in the

GROUP:      bpfman.io
KIND:       BpfApplication
VERSION:    v1alpha1

FIELD: conditions <[]Object>


DESCRIPTION:
    conditions contains the summary state for all eBPF programs defined in the
    BPF Application instance for all the Kubernetes nodes in the cluster.
    Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API
    Resource.
    ---
    This struct is intended for direct use as an array at the field path
    .status.conditions.  For example,
    
    
    	type FooStatus struct{
    	    // Represents the observations of a foo's current state.
    	    // Known .status.conditions.type are: "Available", "Progressing", and
    "Degraded"
    	    // +patchMergeKey=type
    	    // +patchStrategy=merge
    	    // +listType=map
    	    // +listMapKey=type
    	    Conditions []metav1.Condition `json:"conditions,omitempty"
    patchStrategy:"merge" patchMergeKey:"type"
    protobuf:"bytes,1,rep,name=conditions"`
    
    
    	    // other fields
    	}
    
FIELDS:
  lastTransitionTime	<string> -required-
    lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one
    status to another.
    This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known,
    then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

  message	<string> -required-
    message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
    This may be an empty string.

  observedGeneration	<integer>
    observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition
    was set based upon.
    For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the
    .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
    with respect to the current state of the instance.

  reason	<string> -required-
    reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the
    condition's last transition.
    Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and
    meanings for this field,
    and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
    The value should be a CamelCase string.
    This field may not be empty.

  status	<string> -required-
  enum: True, False, Unknown
    status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

  type	<string> -required-
    type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
    ---
    Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available,
    but because arbitrary conditions can be
    useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is
    important.
    The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)
